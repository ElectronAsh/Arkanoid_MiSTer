# Arkanoid (arcade) core for [MiSTer Board](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki) 

Mostly running now, but needs so fixes for the sprites, and controller / paddle support adding.

It also doesn't implement the MC68705 MCU, so for now it only runs some of the bootleg ROMs.

The core is using the T80 CPU, by Daniel Wallner, with fixes by MikeJ, Sorgelig, and others.

The YM2149 core is also by MikeJ, and Sorgelig.

I used the MiSTer ZX81 core as a template project for Arkanoid, which was before I got used to how to use github. lol
(which I'm still in the process of learning.)

So there are still references to the ZX81 in the repo.
